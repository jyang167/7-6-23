Initially released on February 17th 2023, The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is Samsung's most cutting-edge flagship smartphone. It features the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset which provides a 15% performance increase over last years phone, not only that, it houses a new 200MP main camera which is up on last years 108MP camera. The selfie camera is also improved, going from a 10MP camera to a 12MP camera.

However, it seemed that those changes were not enough for hardcore Samsung fans as the phone was slated for being too iterative over last year's offering.

The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra retails at £1,249 for the 256GB model and £1,399 and £1,599 for the 512GB and 1TB models respectively.
